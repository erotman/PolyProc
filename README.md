# PolyProc
PolyProc is to to import, process, and analyze 3DXRD datasets of varying dimensions, from 2D to higher dimensions.
Through effective computational routines, the toolbox allows us to align and track features in a highly accurate, efficient, and robust manner.

# Dependency
MTEX is a required Dependency for the code (https://mtex-toolbox.github.io).

(PolyProc codes are compatible with MTEX v. 5.1 and beyond)

MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox is required Dependency for the code (https://www.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization.html).
