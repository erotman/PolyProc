# PolyProc
PolyProc is to to import, process, and analyze 3DXRD datasets of varying dimensions, from 2D to higher dimensions.
Through effective computational routines, the toolbox allows us to align and track features in a highly accurate, efficient, and robust manner.

PolyProc is an open source MATLAB toolbox for the processing and analysis of grain maps across space and time. Its main features are ...

* registration of multiple 3D data sets
* grain map clean up routines (filtering low qualitiy data, removal of small grains, etc)
* statistical analysis - texture(IPF), grain volume histogram, topology(number of neighbors), grain boundary misorientation, compactness(sphericity)
* visualization - 3D volume, 2D slice, grain boundary, multimodal, PMDF
* grain tracking
    

# Dependency
PolyProc requires the following dependencies:

1. MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox is required Dependency for alignment part of the code
(https://www.mathworks.com/products/global-optimization.html).
2. MTEX is a required Dependency for the code (https://mtex-toolbox.github.io)
(PolyProc codes are compatible with MTEX v. 5.1 and beyond)
3. Other required Dependencies are already included in `PolyProc/utilities`.
